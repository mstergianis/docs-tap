# Setting up a Tanzu Application Platform GUI authentication provider

Tanzu Application Platform GUI extends the current Backstage's authentication plug-in so that you
can see a login page based on the authentication providers configured at installation.
This feature is a work in progress. It currently supports the following authentication providers
as standard:

- [Auth0](https://backstage.io/docs/auth/auth0/provider)
- [Azure](https://backstage.io/docs/auth/microsoft/provider)
- [Bitbucket](https://backstage.io/docs/auth/bitbucket/provider)
- [GitHub](https://backstage.io/docs/auth/github/provider)
- [GitLab](https://backstage.io/docs/auth/gitlab/provider)
- [Google](https://backstage.io/docs/auth/google/provider)
- [Okta](https://backstage.io/docs/auth/okta/provider)
- [OneLogin](https://backstage.io/docs/auth/onelogin/provider)

## <a id='config-auth-prov'></a> Configure an authentication provider

Configure a supported authentication provider or a custom OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider:

- To configure a supported authentication provider, see the
[Backstage authentication documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/auth/).

- To configure a custom OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider, edit your `tap-values.yaml` or your custom
  configuration file to include an OIDC authentication provider.
  Configure the OIDC provider with your OAuth App values. For example:

  ```yaml
  shared:
    ingress_domain: "INGRESS-DOMAIN"

  tap_gui:
    service_type: ClusterIP
    app_config:
      app:
        baseUrl: http://tap-gui.INGRESS-DOMAIN
      catalog:
        locations:
          - type: url
            target: https://GIT-CATALOG-URL/catalog-info.yaml
      backend:
        baseUrl: http://tap-gui.INGRESS-DOMAIN
        cors:
          origin: http://tap-gui.INGRESS-DOMAIN
  #Existing values file above
      auth:
        environment: development
        session:
          secret: custom session secret
        providers:
          oidc:
            development:
              metadataUrl: ${AUTH_OIDC_METADATA_URL}
              clientId: ${AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_ID}
              clientSecret: ${AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET}
              tokenSignedResponseAlg: ${AUTH_OIDC_TOKEN_SIGNED_RESPONSE_ALG} # default='RS256'
              scope: ${AUTH_OIDC_SCOPE} # default='openid profile email'
              prompt: auto # default=none (allowed values: auto, none, consent, login)
  ```

  Where `metadataUrl` is a JSON file with generic OIDC provider configuration.
  It contains `authorizationUrl` and `tokenUrl`.
  These values are read from the `metadataUrl` file by Tanzu Application Platform GUI,
  so you must not specify these values explicitly in the earlier authentication configuration.

  Part of the [OAuth 2.0
  specification](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-3.1.2) is that
  authorization servers (identity providers) need to be able to redirect a user
  back to the application that started the authentication flow. As such, you
  also need to provide a piece of information to your identity provider, the
  redirect URI, sometimes also called redirect URL or callback URL/URI, of the
  TAP GUI instance. This takes the form of
  ```
  SCHEME://tap-gui.INGRESS-DOMAIN/api/auth/oidc/handler/frame

  ```

  Where:
  * `SCHEME`: is the URI scheme, most commonly `http` or `https`
  * `INGRESS-DOMAIN`: is the hostname you selected for your TAP GUI instance

  Which when using https and example.com as examples for the two placeholders
  respectively we arrive at the redirect URI of:

  ```
  https://tap-gui.example.com/api/auth/oidc/handler/frame
  ```

  For more information, see
  [this example](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/e4ab91cf571277c636e3e112cd82069cdd6fca1f/app-config.yaml#L333-L347)
  in GitHub.

## <a id='allow-guest-access'></a> (Optional) Allow guest access

Enable guest access with other providers by adding the following flag under your authentication
configuration:

```yaml
auth:
  allowGuestAccess: true
```

## <a id='customize-login'></a> (Optional) Customize the login page

Change the card's title or description for a specific provider with the following configuration:

```yaml
auth:
  environment: development
  providers:
    ... # auth providers config
  loginPage:
    github:
      title: Github Login
      message: Enter with your GitHub account
```

For a provider to appear on the login page, ensure it is properly configured under the `auth.providers`
section of your values file.
